   BCM/ECM ALDL MODES:

       THIS IS THE MAJOR WAY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE VEHICLE, BY
   RECEIVING THE ALDL's $F0 POLL AND RESPONDING, PUTTING THE ECM
   AND/OR BCM IN DIFFERENT MODES AND GETTING THEIR ALDL DATA LISTS.
   AFTER RECEIVING THE ALDL'S $F0 POLL THE TOOL
MUST ANSWER THE POLL
   WITH A MESSAGE THAT HAS THE FOLLOWING CONTENT IN THIS FORMAT.
   THE FIRST BYTE WILL BE THE DEVICE ID ($F0).  THE SECOND BYTE WILL
   BE THE MESSAGE BYTE COUNT (ALWAYS $04, IF NOT ALL MODE BYTES ARE
   USED FILL THEM WITH NULLS $00).  THE THIRD AND FOURTH BYTES (1st
   AND 2nd DATA BYTES) ARE ECM MODES (see ECM ALDL modes), THE FIFTH
   AND SIXTH BYTES (3rd AND 4th DATA BYTES) ARE BCM MODES (see BCM
   ALDL modes).  THE SEVENTH AND FINAL BYTE IS THE CHECK SUM.                

       BCM ALDL MODES:

          - MODE #0 - NULL MODE
              When the BCM receives a Mode 0 it will terminate
            execution of an active BCM mode and allow that mode to
            return to normal engine operation.

          - MODE #1 - SERVICE ALDL
              This mode will only send the desired ALDL data list.
            No vehicle function will be modified during this mode.

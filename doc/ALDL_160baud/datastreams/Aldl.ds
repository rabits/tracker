G.M. unidirectional serial data format 80, 100, 160 baud
--------------------------------------------------------

Serial Data Format
  The serial data output is a bit synchronized, byte oriented scheme
  with software transmitting 1-bit at a time in a serial format. Data
  bytes are transmitted in a binary 9-bit format, one start bit followed
  by 8-data bits (highest order bit first).



Bit Timing

  Each bit is transmitted by first causing a high to low transition on
  the data line (t0), low indicating driver on. If the bit is a logic
  "0", the data line goes high at (t1); if the bit is a "1", the data
  line goes high at a later time (t3). The receiver samples the value
  of the signal at (t2) which is between (t1) and (t3). The next bit
  starts at (t4) with another high to low transition.

Data Protocol

  The serial data protocol consists of the data and control character
  sequences and procedures required to transmit a message with sufficient
  intelligence to allow a receiving station to properly decode.

  The protocol for the serial data output consists of the "start bit"
  which is the bit preceding each 8-bit data byte (forming a 9-bit byte
  transmission), and the "sync" character which precedes each transmitted
  message.

  The protocol is designed to allow a receiving station to "sync" itself
  anytime it receives 9 or more consecutive "1's" followed by a "0".
  When the ECM initiates a transmission, it must preface the message
  with a "sync" character ($FF) with a "1" start bit. Once "sync-ed",
  as many data bytes as desired may be transmitted, each preceded by a
  "0" start bit. Issuing each data byte with a "0" start bit insures
  that no more than 8 consecutive "1's" can occur within the data string
  thus eliminating the possibility of a "sync" command being buried
  within the data.

  Once a transmission is complete, the ECM retransmits the contents of
  the same memory locations (the RAM memory contents may change between
  transmissions). To do this, the last data byte is followed by another
  "sync" character, which will "re-sync" the receiver prior to message
  retransmission.
